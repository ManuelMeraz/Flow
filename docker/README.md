A docker image is available to start playing around with this library without installing it onto your machine. 


```
./build.sh # Pulls the docker image and builds a local docker image
./start.sh # Starts the docker container and attaches to it
```

If you leave bash session you may reattach with:

```
./bash.sh # attaches to the container again if previously disconnected
```

From there you should be able to clone this repo and run the `sripts/build.py` script to build this project
